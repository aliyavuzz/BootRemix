Experimental UEFI fan + PC speaker remix for HP Pavilion dv6

BootRemix is a low-level, experimental UEFI project that plays simple 8‑bit style melodies and rhythmic effects by directly controlling the cooling fan and PC speaker during the boot process. 
My old HP laptop's fan was working noisier than a jet engine, thus I decided to use it as a percussion for my 8 bit music. 

This project is not intended for general use. It is a learning experiment. And I couldnt be able to compile the code yet, so even if you have a HP Pavilion dv6 you want to burn, please check the code upfront. And please let me know if you are able to do it :)


Booting your device with this is dangerous, even its the same model. For other models, probably it would burn your cpu, or shutdown, idk.
